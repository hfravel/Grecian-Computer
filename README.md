# Grecian-Computer
This is a program to solve the Grecian Computer puzzle (As seen above in the image). 
There is another image in the resources folder ('solution.jpg') that shows the solved puzzle. 
The Grecian Computer is a puzzle disc where there are 4 discs and a bottom layer. 
The bottom layer and the four discs have numbers on them which create 12 columns and 4 rows. 
The discs also have holes in them to allow numbers from a previous level to show. 
The objective of the puzzle is to get all 12 columns to total 42.
# Antikythera Mechanism
This puzzle is based off The Antikythera mechanism. 
This is an ancient greek hand-powered orrery that was discovered in 1901 in a shipwreck off the coast of the greek island, Antikythera. 
This contraption is labeled as the first Analogue computer. 
I gathered this information from wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism
