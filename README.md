# Antikythera Mechanism
This puzzle is based off The Antikythera mechanism. This is an ancient greek hand-powered orrery that was discovered in 1901 in a shipwreck off the coast of the greek island, Antikythera. This contraption is labeled as the first Analogue computer. I gathered this information from wikipedia: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera_mechanism
